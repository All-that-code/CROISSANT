                <p>A <strong>croissant</strong> (French:
                    [kʁwasɑ̃]) is a French pastry made from puff pastry in a crescent shape.<br /><br />

                    It is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using
                    the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent
                    shape. The
                    dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin
                    sheet, in a technique
                    called laminating.
                    The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.<br /><br />

                    Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly
                    since antiquity. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century when French bakers
                    replaced the brioche
                    dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated dough.</p>
